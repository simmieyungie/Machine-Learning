# Machine-Learning
The repository contains machine learning algorithms I have implemented

#### Machine learning is the scientific study of algorithms and statistical models that computer systems use to perform a specific task without using explicit instructions, relying on patterns and inference instead

##### This repository contains implementation of Machine learning algorithms majorly on kaggle dataset

Algorithms implemented Include:
- Random Forest
- Decision Trees
- Logistics regression
- Naive Bayes
